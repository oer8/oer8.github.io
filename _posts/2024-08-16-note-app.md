I want to be able to type a key combination on my PC and immediately start typing a note, no matter what else I was working on before. The note should appear in a new window instantaneously (seemingly), and should be "saved" automatically. The note should automatically be assigned a good title. None of this "Untitled 1" nonsense.

The above is most important. I wonder how hard it would be to make it fast enough on contemporary operating systems. It'd be valuable enough to me to determine my choice of (non-work) system. Once I have it, it'd be nice to also have:

* Ctrl-Enter should dimiss the note window
* typing [ should find-as-you-type select another note to link
* typing ] immediately after a phrase should linkify and open a note titled with that new phrase (maybe AI for figuring out where a phrase starts and ends)
* linkify-and-open should also be available via right click menu

At some point, it would be lovely if these notes inluded a link to the document that was in focus when they were created, in the spirit of iOS quick notes. Even better would be for them to be easily accessible from that document. In particular, a web browser could show them as a type of hyperlink, like [Hypothesis](http://hypothes.is) does.
