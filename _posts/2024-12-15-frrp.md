title: Functional Relational Reactive Programming
---
You can simply refer to fields on events and reactive objects.

## basic reactivity
    a = 123
    b = a * 2
    //b is 246
    a = 234
    //now b is 468

## objects
    dan_smith:
        name = "Daniel Smith"
        school = "Something Academy"
        gpa = 4.0

    mr_dan_smith:
        dan_smith.with:
            title = "Mr."

## functions and immutability
    treble(x): x * 3
    b = treble(a)

    f():
        m = 2
        return x * m

    g(x):
        b = 234 //does not compile: only the repl can reassign "globals"
        return 234

    h():
        a:
            name = "Daniel Smith"
            school = "Something Academy"
        b = a.with:
            gpa = 4.0
        a.school = "Other School" //does not compile: objects are immutable
        return b

## object sets
Here's where we dramatically diverge from FRP. The "a" or "an" prefix defines a reactive object set.
<pre>
<b>a</b> student:
    name = NewStudentMsg.name
    school = NewStudentMsg.school
    gpa = average(CourseCompleted.grade or 0)
</pre>

    student_body:
        size: count(student)
        average_gpa: average(student.gpa)

        //since it's not "student.gpa or 0", there is
        // no student body until there are students,
        // kind of like an sql "inner join"
    

## first class reactivity
    a student:
        f(NewStudentMsg).with:
            gpa = average(CourseCompleted.grade or 0)

    f(s):
        return:
            name = s.name
            school = s.school

## structural typing

    a groovy_student:
        f(NewStudentMsg) or f(NewHomeSchoolerMsg)

    g(s):
        return:
            full_name = s.name

    a not_groovy_student:
        f(NewStudentMsg) or g(NewHomeSchoolerMsg) //does not compile

## templates

TODO

## boring and TODO

arithmetic, comparisons, loops, conditionals, lists, subobjects, hash tables

## nerdier stuff

Functions cannot even read from members of object sets that are not passed as parameters.

## questions

What is the best use of ":" vs "="? Next line vs same line? Or function/object vs simple variable?

Do we want functions reading from regular reactive objects? What can we do to make a comfortable language subset for configuration use cases?

Do we want to support variable rebinding? Or can we just have a better support for looping and refining a value, and for chaining steps without intermediate names?

Do IDs need to be visible in the language, or just in the serialization?
