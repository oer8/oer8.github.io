title: Functional Relational Reactive Programming
---
You can simply refer to fields on events and reactive objects.

## basic reactivity
    a = 123
    b = a * 2
    //b is 246
    a = 234
    //now b is 468

## compound objects
    dan_smith:
        name = "Daniel Smith"
        school = "Something Academy"
        gpa = 4.0

    mr_dan_smith:
        dan_smith.with:
            title = "Mr."
            status = 100

## functions and immutability
<pre>
treble(x):
    return x * 3

b = treble(a)

f():
    m = 2
    return x * m

g(x):
<span style="color:red">    b = 234</span> //does not compile
    //only the repl can reassign "globals"
    return 234

h():
    a:
        name = "Daniel Smith"
        school = "Something Academy"

<span style="color:red">    a.school = "Other School"</span> //does not compile
    //objects are immutable

    b = a.with:
        school = "Other School"
    return b

## reactive sets
Here's where we dramatically diverge from FRP. The "a" or "an" prefix defines a reactive set.
<pre>
<b>a</b> student:
    name = NewStudentMsg.name
    school = NewStudentMsg.school
    gpa = average(CourseCompleted.grade or 0)
</pre>

    student_body:
        size: count(student)
        average_gpa: average(student.gpa)

        //since it's not "student.gpa or 0", there is
        // no student body until there are students,
        // kind of like an sql "inner join"
    

## first class reactivity
    a student:
        f(NewStudentMsg).with:
            gpa = average(CourseCompleted.grade or 0)

    f(s):
        return:
            name = s.name
            school = s.school

## structural typing
<pre>
a groovy_student:
    f(NewStudentMsg) or f(NewHomeSchoolerMsg)

g(s):
    return:
        full_name = s.name

a not_groovy_student:
   <span style="color:red">f</span>(NewStudentMsg) or <span style="color:red">g</span>(NewHomeSchoolerMsg)
    //does not compile
</pre>

## big plans

Everything persists across restarts. Can this be used in place of SQL as well as scripting?

## templates

The vibe jibes with templates. Perhaps we could embed in a document without too much extra syntax or machinery.

## boring and TODO

arithmetic, comparisons, loops, conditionals, lists, subobjects, hash tables

## nerdier stuff

Functions cannot even read from members of object sets that are not passed as parameters.

We'll want some optimization in order to be able to support "perl -pie" type use cases.

## questions

What is the best use of ":" vs "="? Next line vs same line? Or function/object vs simple variable?

Do we want functions reading from regular reactive objects? What can we do to make a comfortable language subset for configuration use cases?

Do we want to support variable rebinding? Or can we just have a better support for looping and refining a value, and for chaining steps without intermediate names?

Do IDs need to be visible in the language, or just in the serialization?
