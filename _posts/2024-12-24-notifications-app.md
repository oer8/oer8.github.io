There ought to be an app for paging through "news" and timely posts, a single front end for the list view of all of: email, whatsapp, web sites, and social networking sites.

Sure, there're differences, but they are not big enough to justify paging through multiple separate lists.

Unifying the interface could have more salutory effects: it could enable new platforms to better compete, and it could one day support factoring out the "algorithm", the smarts about which posts to emphasize.

A first step could leverage the notifications APIs, which are already supported by all mainstream operating systems and newsy applications. None of the current user interfaces for viewing notifications is good enough, having just evolved from attention-getting noises. Unfortunately, Apple really doesn't want third party developers to build something here.
